            <h2>Who am I</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings and hello. It's so wonderful to see you. That's right, I'm looking at you right now. What? You don't believe me? Well that's fine. It's only a figure of speech.
            </p>
            <p>
                As if you couldn't tell by now, I'm a tad strange. I enjoy making light of the darkest of situations. I love to problem solve. I love philosophical debates. I am a bit of a trickster. I have a fiance. I have three letter I's in my name. That might be the reason why I have been using the letter I so much in this paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a side note, is I considered a word? Send me an email with your thoughts. And possibly a job offer. I would actually prefer a job offer...
            </p>
